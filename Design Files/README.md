# Design Files

The files included are:

1. Laser cut plates, we suggest to use 5mm acrylic. The thickness must be chosen in relation to the lenght of the screw used with t-nuts for assembly, if the thickness is too thin and the screws are too long, the screws will touch the internal channel of the aluminum frame and the plates will not be locked in place.

2. 3D printed pen lift. It is designed to use a small section of linear guide and standard slider, it can mount a standard 9g Servo Motor and it must be equipped with a rubber band to act as a spring that pushes the pen down.

3. The pen holding ring is large enough for several size of pens and markers.

4. The 3D printed parts do not require any support or brim for printing.
